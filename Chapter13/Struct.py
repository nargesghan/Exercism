'''What use cases can you think of in which the struct module would be useful for either
reading or writing binary data?
'''

'''Network Programming: When sending and receiving data over a network,
 itâ€™s often necessary to ensure that data is in a specific format.
  The struct module can be used to pack and unpack data into the required format.'''


'''When writing programs that deal with data compression or decompression,
 the struct module can be used to handle the binary data formats used in the compression algorithms.'''
